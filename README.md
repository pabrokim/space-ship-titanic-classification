# space-ship-titanic-classification
This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition, where the objective is to predict which passengers were transported to another dimension during a mysterious interstellar disaster. The project includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and various machine learning modelsâ€”primarily tree-based classifiers like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. I experimented with different preprocessing techniques, handled missing values, and engineered new features from the available columns such as Cabin and PassengerGroup. The final submission uses an ensemble of the best-performing models, tuned through cross-validation to optimize prediction accuracy.
